			<h5>First Project Via Scratch: Help Space Dog Find His Way Home</h5>
			<p>
				<font size = "6"> This is my scratch game. We chose to do a combination of a story and a game. The goal of the story is to help Space Dog find hs way home. Navigate Space Dog by using the arrow keys. When you reach the game, dodge the asteroids using your mouse to guide the rocket. 
						Dodge 20 asteroids to reach Earth safely. Throughout the game, we implemented various code blocks. We used an accumulator to keep track of the score during the game. We also had to calculate the path of the asteroids and used nested else-if statements so that each
						asteroid would randomly move from an x and y position. One of the coolest functions we implemented was an animation of the rocket and earth so that it appears that the earth is getting closer to the rocketship.

			<h5>Second Project Via MIT App Inventor: Mini Golf</h5>
		<p>
		<font size = "6"> This is my second project. We chose to code a mini golf game using MIT APP Inventor. The app uses touch screen applications such that you can fling the golf ball in any direction and it will bounce off the edges. 
			Like the game of golf, the goal of the game is to get the ball in the hole in as few tries as possible. Some details about the code: we used accumulators to keep track of scores and holes, we used randomizing variables to
			reset a new stage, and we used incrementers and decrementers to adjust the speed of the golf ball. Using several loops, the ball is able to move while a certain condition is true. We also used boolean logic as well as nested 
			if-else statements to set certain conditions of the ball. The difficult part was making a contact block that would allow the ball to bounce off an object when contact is made.</h6>

				<h5>Third Project Via Repl.it: Interactive Fiction - Castaway</h5>
<p>
		<font size = "6"> This is my third project. We created an interactive fiction story using repl.it and the coding language Python 2.7. The theme we chose was survival; thus, the background of the story is that you are a castaway stuck on an island and you need to make the correct 
				  choices/decisions to survive and eventually make it back home. The majority of the code is comprised of if-else statements. However, some paths require a certain condition to be true. For that, we used boolean comparisons to 
			          mark true/false situations. Because we began with the flowchart, actually coding the story was fairly simple once we understood the syntax and rules in Python 2.7. The only difficult task was keeping track of the many paths, so 
				  we made sure to comment the method headers and pathways.</h6>

		<h4>Fourth Project Via NetLogo: Simulation - Fireworks</h4>
		
		<p>
			<font size = "6"> Below is a video of my NetLogo project which models the action of fireworks. Rockets begin at the bottom of the view, 
				          shoot upwards into the sky and then explode, emitting showers of falling sparks. The fireworks represented in this model 
				          were modified from the original type. I created more complex kinds of fireworks. Some have multiple explosions and colors, 
					  and some are random. Each rocket is launched upward with an initial x and y velocity. At a certain point in the sky, an 
					  explosion occurs. Each fragment inherits the same the velocity from the original rocket in addition to velocity from the 
					  explosion itself. The result is a simulation of a fireworks display.

<h4>Fifth Project via Tkinter: GUI Calculator</h4>
		
		<p>
			<font size = "6"> Below is a picture of my GUI project which is simply a modification of a four function calculator. I was working on type casting for the Java
					  integer and double variables, so I decided to make a calculator that performed accordingly. Thus, an integer divided or 
				          multiplied by a double would equal a double. An integer divided or multipled by an integer would remain an integer. Since doubles 
				          are larger data types than int, the calculator can downcast double to int. Double is 64-bit primitive value and when you cast 
				          it to 32-bit integer, anything after the decimal point is lost.

<h4>Sixth Project via Repl.it: Data Analysis</h4>
		<p>
			<font size = "6"> I wanted to investigate the percentages of 5s earned on the AP Computer Science A test over time. Originally, I was going to find data for
				          AP Computer Science Principles, but the class was relatively new (2016), so there was few data given by College Board. The question I 
				          asked was, "How has the percentage of wtudents who earned a 5 on the AP Computer Science test changed over time?" To collect data, I went to 
				          College Board's archived data which gave percentages from 2005 to 2019. Using repl.it
				          and Python, I graphed the data. The lowest percentage was in 2005 because in that year, College Board transitioned from C++ to Java. It changed again in 2011
					  which explains the negative trend for several years until 2017.
