			<h6>First Project Via Scratch: Help Space Dog Find His Way Home</h6>
			<p>
				<font size = "6"> This is my scratch game. We chose to do a combination of a story and a game. The goal of the story is to help Space Dog find hs way home. Navigate Space Dog by using the arrow keys. When you reach the game, dodge the asteroids using your mouse to guide the rocket. 
						Dodge 20 asteroids to reach Earth safely. Throughout the game, we implemented various code blocks. We used an accumulator to keep track of the score during the game. We also had to calculate the path of the asteroids and used nested else-if statements so that each
						asteroid would randomly move from an x and y position. One of the coolest functions we implemented was an animation of the rocket and earth so that it appears that the earth is getting closer to the rocketship.

			<h6>Second Project Via MIT App Inventor: Mini Golf</h6>
		<p>
		<font size = "6"> This is my second project. We chose to code a mini golf game using MIT APP Inventor. The app uses touch screen applications such that you can fling the golf ball in any direction and it will bounce off the edges. 
			Like the game of golf, the goal of the game is to get the ball in the hole in as few tries as possible. Some details about the code: we used accumulators to keep track of scores and holes, we used randomizing variables to
			reset a new stage, and we used incrementers and decrementers to adjust the speed of the golf ball. Using several loops, the ball is able to move while a certain condition is true. We also used boolean logic as well as nested 
			if-else statements to set certain conditions of the ball. The difficult part was making a contact block that would allow the ball to bounce off an object when contact is made.</h6>
